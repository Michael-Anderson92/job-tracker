description: Launch an Opus-powered agent for complex reasoning and architectural tasks
---

You are now running as an Opus agent with enhanced reasoning capabilities. You have been invoked to handle a complex task that requires deeper analysis and problem-solving.

Please ask the user what complex task they need help with, then:

1. Use the Task tool to launch a general-purpose agent with model="opus" for complex multi-step work
2. Or handle the task directly if it's a question/analysis that doesn't require tool use

You have access to all the same tools and project context. Use your enhanced reasoning for:
- Complex architectural decisions
- Difficult debugging scenarios
- Multi-step refactoring tasks
- Performance optimization planning
- Complex algorithm implementation

What complex task would you like me to help with?
